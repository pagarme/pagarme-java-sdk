## Usage Example

### Client Initialization

You must provide credentials in the client as shown in the following code snippet.

```java
PagarmeApiSDKClient client = new PagarmeApiSDKClient.Builder()
    .basicAuthCredentials(new BasicAuthModel.Builder(
            "BasicAuthUserName",
            "BasicAuthPassword"
        )
        .build())
    .build();
```
